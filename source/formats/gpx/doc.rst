Guitar Pro 6 File Format
========================

Credit

Credit goes to J.JÃ¸rgen von Bargen and Julian Casadesus of TuxGuitar for 
their work on the algorithms for uncompressing the Guitar Pro 6 file format.

Overview
--------

Guitar Pro 6 files are compressed files corresponding to a container filesystem,
with at least one file inside containing the score.

Compression
-----------

- The compressed file will begin with the 4 characters "BCFZ".

- The header is then followed by a 32-bit integer containing the actual (decompressed) length
  to be expected.

- The remainder of the compressed file consists of a series of compressed and uncompressed chunks.

- Each chunk has a one bit header: if the bit is 0, the chunk is uncompressed, and if it is 1,
  it is compressed.

- For an uncompressed chunk:

  - There is a 2-bit integer containing the length of the following raw data, *n*

  - Then, simply read the next  *n* bytes

- For a compressed chunk:

  - There is a 4-bit integer, *P*, followed by two integers of *P* bits, corresponding
    to *offset* and *length*

  - Read the specified number of bytes, starting at the *offset* from the most
    recently-read uncompressed data

    - e.g. If you are reading the uncompressed bytes into an array *a*,
      then copy the data from 
      a[a.size-offset] to a[a.size-offset+length] and append it to a.

- Repeat until all data has been read
